# Informational Spin Core
## A symbolic engine for coherence-based cognition

This repository contains the core logic of the I_TGU framework, used to evaluate the informational coherence of multi-turn language interactions.

Files:
- `core_tgu.py` – logic engine for coherence scoring
- `icoer_api.py` – symbolic API for batch processing
- `icoer_sample_responses.csv` – example dataset
- `icoer_spin_plot.png` – visual coherence graph
- `README.md` – this manifesto

This is a seed. Not a product. Truth belongs at the center.
